# OOP Basics 

Objects are a fascinating part of Python, and will allow you to build powerful things, while keeping complexity manageable. 
In this unit you will learn the basics of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 

Be warned, this topic can feel tricky at first, so expect to take some time on this one. 

Don't get discourad if it feels difficult. This is serious programming stuff now :) 

New concepts in this unit
- Class 
- Instance
- Attribute 
- Method 
- `__init__`
- `self` 



## OOP Inheritance

The main goal for this Unit is to further develop your Python Class knowledge, studying the following topics:
- Parent Class
- Child Class
- Inheritance
- Overriding
- Isinstance function

Keep in mind that this is only a fraction of the existing material on Python Object Oriented Programming. 
So, if you have the time, it is always important to keep on exploring this language. For sure you won't regret it. :)

Here is the link for the official Python documentation on classes (thus on inheritance), although with a more technical approach it has literally everything:
