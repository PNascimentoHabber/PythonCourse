## Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating jupyter notebook documents. A jupyter notebook document integrates code and its output into a single document that can also have visualizations, narrative text, mathematical equations, and other rich media. This promotes iterative and rapid development, making notebooks an increasingly popular choice for data scientists. For this reason, we will use jupyter notebook.
The purpose of this week is for you to become familiar with this tool.
I will teach you the basics and some tips and tricks that I've used. 
However, the biggest takeaway is this:
Whenever you're using your mouse to work with Jupyter Notebook, try to find a shortcut instead! If you do this enough times, you'll be a Jupyter Notebook pro in no time! Good luck!
