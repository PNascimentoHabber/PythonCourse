# Linear Algebra

In this unit you'll be introduced to Linear Algebra, a key subject for data scientists. You'll learn how you can handle matrices and vectors, their main properties and basic operations, the intuitions
 behind the "linear" in Linear Algebra, and how to apply basic matrix operations using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (v1.18), the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. You'll learn how to
 create numpy arrays, understand their shape and dimension, how to subset rows and columns in matrices (2D arrays), and perform concatenation.
