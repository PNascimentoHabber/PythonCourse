# Flow Control

In this Unit, We'll learn how to control the execution of your code and harnest the power of programming!

We'll start by reviewing and expanding our knowledge of booleans. These are going to be used next to control which part of your code is executed.

We'll then be (healthly) lazy and tell Python to repeat code without writing the same statement over and over again.

We'll concluded with a new method of building lists.

## Functions Fundamentals

You'll get your first exposure to the most fundamental and powerful tool common to all
programming languages: functions! In this Learning Unit, you'll get your first exposure in how to construct them
but by no means will you be an expert in them and that's okay. It takes years to master the composition of functions
in each programming language.

If there is one takeaway from this Learning Unit, it would have to be:


### Avoid repeating code by using functions

Instead of reapeating code, you should put the code into a function and call that function. 

That's it. Really. The most common and severe mistake that programmers make is to copy-paste the same code 
into multiple places rather than put it into a function. It takes a bit of extra brainpower but, in the end,
it, literally, always saves more time than it takes.

## Functions Intermediate

When you've got some fundamentals when it comes to functions, let's take a look at a few ways in which they can be
implemented and used. Since functions are all about allowing us to organize our code, the different ways functions can be
used gives us a totally new set of superpowers.


### Keyword arguments

Keyword arguments give you a new way to style your function inputs. With keyword args, you get a few nice things:

- Help the user of your function by providing default values to arguments
- When calling functions, makes it easier to read


### Scope

Scope is all about understanding how variables inside and outside of a function. It is absolutely fundamental to understand
when working with Jupyter Notebooks and will save you sooooooooo many debugging sessions in the future.
