# Programming Basics

In this Learning Unit, you'll be introduced to the world of Python programming. You'll start by learning what programming is and where to look for additional materials.
You'll then learn about the `print()` function and how you can use it to your advantage. You'll also see how to comment your code to improve readability.

Then the interesting part: using basic data and operations. You'll see how to use several data types and the respective operations to manipulate data and obtain the results that you want. You'll be introduced to the concept of *operator precedence*.

Last but definitely not the least, you'll store the results of your calculations inside variables for later use.

Hope that you enjoy the ride and have fun.

# Data Structures

A Data Structure is a collection of data that enables data organization, management, and storage. 

This unit covers theory and practical exercises regarding 3 types of data structures in python: tuples, lists, and dictionaries.    

You can start by learning about these topics with the Learning notebook.
By the time you have learned the concepts regarding data structures, you can jump on the Exercises notebook and test your knowledge. If you fill stuck in an exercise, try to look at the asserts. Sometimes they can give you some extra hints. All the exercises can be done with the material provided.    

After completing the exercises, if you have time, there is also an extra learning notebook. This notebook  has additional methods of data structures that were not covered on the main notebook.
